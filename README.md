cutegtfs is a Qt based library for parsing and querying transit data in GTFS format.

cutegtfs consist on two parts:

A Qt library and example app for parsing GTFS csv data from zip archives
into a sqlite database.

And a database query libary for getting that data out from the sqlite database.

Still work in progress and not ready for use.

Future: Realtime data using various data formats (JSON SIRI)
